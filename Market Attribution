ATTRIBUTION QUERIES

CoolTShirts sells shirts of all kinds, as long as they are T-shaped and cool. 
Recently, CTS started a few marketing campaigns to increase website visits and purchases. 
Using touch attribution, they’d like to map their customers’ journey: from initial visit to purchase. 
They can use that information to optimize their marketing campaigns. 
This project will guide you through some of that process.

QUESTIONS:

1. How many campaigns and sources does CoolTShirts use? Which source is used for each campaign?

Use three queries:

one for the number of distinct campaigns,
one for the number of distinct sources,
one to find how they are related.

2. What pages are on the CoolTShirts website? Find the distinct values of the page_name column.


3. How many first touches is each campaign responsible for?


4. How many last touches is each campaign responsible for?

5. How many visitors make a purchase?

6. How many last touches on the purchase page is each campaign responsible for?

7. CoolTShirts can re-invest in 5 campaigns. Given your findings in the project, which should they pick and why?

7. From query results in question 4. and 6. we can see that that top 5 campaigns for maximum number of first touches and 
last touches that make a purchase are the same. So clearly, the company should reinvest in those 5 campaigns.
